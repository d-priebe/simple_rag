# simple_rag
Repository demonstrates a RAG system capable of processing technical documents, extracting key information and answering complex reasoning based questions 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repo is a modification of a graphRAG tutorial utilizing Langchains MongoDbGraphStore to develop a knowledge graph for a GraphRAG.
Traditional RAG approachs have been shown to have porr perforamnce across multi-hop reasoning problems - Thus the apporach is to align the assignment
of entity extraction with a system/modeling approach inductively aligned with the problem at hand.


Below you will find the sources to the tutorial as well as a breakdown of any modifications/deviations from the traditional apporach.
